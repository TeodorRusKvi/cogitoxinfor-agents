Enable Internal Sales Orders (Internal Sales Orders) 3 (13) 
Overview  
Concept 
 
Process  
This configuration process explains how the system must be set up to enable internal sales 
orders. One major consideration is the Goods-in-transit (GIT) management. As explained in 
the detailed steps, this is controlled by a parameter in ‘Settings – Cost Accounting’ 
(CAS900), which is set Off. 
The project team should decide whether to activate this, as it will have an impact on internal 
sales orders accounting and “external”, or “regular” customer orders and purchase orders. 
Although the Goods-in-transit functionality has not been activated, the process descriptions 
assume that it has been. 
Input  
 
Output  
The settings and basic data are in place for using internal sales orders. 
The project team has chosen whether to activate the Goods-in-transit (GIT) functionality. 
Depending on this, GIT will be managed or not during the internal sales orders process.

Manage Goods-in-transit Settings 
1. Enable Goods-in-transit 
This flag is set to OFF in the delivered IPC configuration. The project team must decide if it 
should be activated or not. 
It must be consistent across all divisions: parameter 29 in CAS900 should be On or Off in all 
divisions within a company. 
The parameters in the remaining part of this documentation are linked to GIT activation. 
 
‘Settings – Cost Accounting’ (CAS900) 
 029 Create goods in transit transactions for CO / PO  
o Check this setting if you are using Goods-in-Transit. Currently, this is left 
unchecked. Once checked in divisions AAA and BBB the accounting setup 
detailed below will be generated. 
2. Define Accounts 
 ‘Accounting Identity. Open’ (CRS630) 
 Division: AAA 
o 13600 Goods in Transit – Sold not Delivered 
 Division BBB 
o 1430 Goods in Transit (flagged as Inventory account) 
o 2470 Ordered not Received (flagged as reconciliation account but not 
inventory) 
 
3. Define Accounting Rules 
‘Number Series. Open’ (CRS165) 
 Verify that number series S2 / D exist for table FAPIBH. This is the supplier invoice 
batch number. If that is not the case, verify that FAM function AP50 exists in the 
buying division. If that is not the case, the system will not automatically create 
number series S2 / D when the selling division has invoiced the internal sales order.

Additional Information  
Test Variants 
 The example internal customer and supplier are set up with delivery terms ‘FOB’, 
which has a goods responsibility code = 2. 
If other delivery terms with goods responsibility code 1 or 3 are set, then this has an 
impact on the goods in transit (GIT) management. This is further explained in the 
process description that explains how goods in transit are managed. 
 Parameter 029 - Create goods in transit transactions for CO/PO – is set off and 
should be set on to be able to manage Goods in Transit. However, the internal sales 
orders process is described as if the parameter was set on. 
 
Tips and Hints  
Kits 
It is possible to use kits in internal sales orders. The only limitation is for kits that are not 
supported in purchase orders, that is: variable kits with fixed price at header level. 
The product structure is taken from the buying facility; if there is a global facility and no 
product structure in the buying facility, then the product structure is taken from the global 
facility. 
Please note that if the reservation and pricing are at the kit components level, no kit header is 
created in the customer order, only the kit lines are created. 
 
Attributes 
The pre-set attributes in this IPC solution have been created to support the Country of origin; 
they are set as balance identity attributes and as such are not carried over from the 
dispatching warehouse to the receiving warehouse in an internal sales order process. 
Attributes can be carried over from the dispatching warehouse to the receiving warehouse in 
an internal sales order process if they fulfill the following conditions: 
 They are set at lot master (controlling object 2) 
 They are flagged to be included in CO and in PO. 
 
QMS (Quality Management System) 
QMS can be supported in internal sales orders in the same way as in distribution orders. In 
addition, the QMS specifications to be copied must have auto-attach = 1 in QMS200/E for the 
results to be transferred upon QI request creation. 
The main settings to consider are: 
 ‘ Specifications. Open’ (QMS200): ‘Auto-attach’ 
 ‘ Specification Test’ (QMS201): ‘Copy DO results’ 
 ‘ Quality Plan Item Warehouse. Open’ (QMS015): ‘DO test at rec’ and ‘DO copy tst 
res’. 
If needed, exceptions per supplier may be set through custom specifications and specification 
entities with entity type 2-Supplier.

Historic Actual Cost (HAC) and Goods-in-transit (GIT) 
The Historic Actual Cost (HAC) calculation is not currently supported in combination with the 
Goods in Transit (GIT) functionality. 
 
Line Charges 
Header charges have been setup to enable the addition of header charges at customer order 
that will be copied to the linked purchase order when the customer order is confirmed. 
It is also possible to add line charges, however this has not been configured in this IPC 
solution. 
 
Supply Chain Orders 
If supply chain orders are used, the specific settings for supply chain orders must also be set. 
Note: If applicable, see Preconfigured Data – Supply Chain Orders. 
 
Transportation lead time 
In 'Supplier. Connect Transp Lead Times' (PPS010), both fields 'Transportation lead time 1' 
(TLE1) and 'Transportation lead time 2' (TLE2) are enabled if the supplier is type 7 (internal). 
This allows for the suppliers internal lead time to be taken into account when determining the 
total lead time for internal orders. 
A detailed explanation of how this can affect planning dates can be found in the M3 Business 
Engine User Documentation , document 'Material Planning for Internal Sales', section 'Lead 
time management'.
