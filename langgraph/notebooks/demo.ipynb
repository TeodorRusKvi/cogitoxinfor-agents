In \\naddition, the QMS specifications to be copied must have auto-attach = 1 in QMS200/E for the \\nresults to be transferred upon QI request creation. \\nThe main settings to consider are: \\n\\uf0b7 ‘ Specifications.

This is further explained in the \\nprocess description that explains how goods in transit are managed. \\n\\uf0b7 Parameter 029 - Create goods in transit transactions for CO/PO – is set off and \\nshould be set on to be able to manage Goods in Transit. However, the internal sales \\norders process is described as if the parameter was set on. \\n \\nTips and Hints  \\nKits \\nIt is possible to use kits in internal sales orders. The only limitation is for kits that are not \\nsupported in purchase orders, that is: variable kits with fixed price at header level. \\nThe product structure is taken from the buying facility; if there is a global facility and no \\nproduct structure in the buying facility, then the product structure is taken from the global \\nfacility. \\nPlease note that if the reservation and pricing are at the kit components level, no kit header is \\ncreated in the customer order, only the kit lines are created. \\n \\nAttributes \\nThe pre-set attributes in this IPC solution have been created to support the Country of origin; \\nthey are set as balance identity attributes and as such are not carried over from the \\ndispatching warehouse to the receiving warehouse in an internal sales order process. \\nAttributes can be carried over from the dispatching warehouse to the receiving warehouse in \\nan internal sales order process if they fulfill the following conditions: \\n\\uf0b7 They are set at lot master (controlling object 2) \\n\\uf0b7 They are flagged to be included in CO and in PO. \\n \\nQMS (Quality Management System) \\nQMS can be supported in internal sales orders in the same way as in distribution orders. In \\naddition, the QMS specifications to be copied must have auto-attach = 1 in QMS200/E for the \\nresults to be transferred upon QI request creation. \\nThe main settings to consider are: \\n\\uf0b7 ‘ Specifications. Open’ (QMS200): ‘Auto-attach’ \\n\\uf0b7 ‘ Specification Test’ (QMS201): ‘Copy DO results’ \\n\\uf0b7 ‘ Quality Plan Item Warehouse. Open’ (QMS015): ‘DO test at rec’ and ‘DO copy tst \\nres’. \\nIf needed, exceptions per supplier may be set through custom specifications and specification \\nentities with entity type 2-Supplier. \\n \\nEnable Internal Sales Orders (Internal Sales Orders) 13 (13) \\nHistoric Actual Cost (HAC) and Goods-in-transit (GIT) \\nThe Historic Actual Cost (HAC) calculation is not currently supported in combination with the \\nGoods in Transit (GIT) functionality. \\n \\nLine Charges \\nHeader charges have been setup to enable the addition of header charges at customer order \\nthat will be copied to the linked purchase order when the customer order is confirmed. \\nIt is also possible to add line charges, however this has not been configured in this IPC \\nsolution. \\n \\nSupply Chain Orders \\nIf supply chain orders are used, the specific settings for supply chain orders must also be set. \\nNote: If applicable, see Preconfigured Data – Supply Chain Orders. \\n \\nTransportation lead time \\nIn 'Supplier. Connect Transp Lead Times' (PPS010), both fields 'Transportation lead time 1' \\n(TLE1) and 'Transportation lead time 2' (TLE2) are enabled if the supplier is type 7 (internal). \\nThis allows for the suppliers internal lead time to be taken into account when determining the \\ntotal lead time for internal orders. \\nA detailed explanation of how this can affect planning dates can be found in the M3 Business \\nEngine User Documentation , document 'Material Planning for Internal Sales', section 'Lead \\ntime management'. \\n \""

This is further explained in the \\nprocess description that explains how goods in transit are managed. \\n\\uf0b7 Parameter 029 - Create goods in transit transactions for CO/PO – is set off and \\nshould be set on to be able to manage Goods in Transit. However, the internal sales \\norders process is described as if the parameter was set on. \\n \\nTips and Hints  \\nKits \\nIt is possible to use kits in internal sales orders. The only limitation is for kits that are not \\nsupported in purchase orders, that is: variable kits with fixed price at header level. \\nThe product structure is taken from the buying facility; if there is a global facility and no \\nproduct structure in the buying facility, then the product structure is taken from the global \\nfacility. \\nPlease note that if the reservation and pricing are at the kit components level, no kit header is \\ncreated in the customer order, only the kit lines are created. \\n \\nAttributes \\nThe pre-set attributes in this IPC solution have been created to support the Country of origin; \\nthey are set as balance identity attributes and as such are not carried over from the \\ndispatching warehouse to the receiving warehouse in an internal sales order process. \\nAttributes can be carried over from the dispatching warehouse to the receiving warehouse in \\nan internal sales order process if they fulfill the following conditions: \\n\\uf0b7 They are set at lot master (controlling object 2) \\n\\uf0b7 They are flagged to be included in CO and in PO. \\n \\nQMS (Quality Management System) \\nQMS can be supported in internal sales orders in the same way as in distribution orders. In \\naddition, the QMS specifications to be copied must have auto-attach = 1 in QMS200/E for the \\nresults to be transferred upon QI request creation. \\nThe main settings to consider are: \\n\\uf0b7 ‘ Specifications. Open’ (QMS200): ‘Auto-attach’ \\n\\uf0b7 ‘ Specification Test’ (QMS201): ‘Copy DO results’ \\n\\uf0b7 ‘ Quality Plan Item Warehouse. Open’ (QMS015): ‘DO test at rec’ and ‘DO copy tst \\nres’. \\nIf needed, exceptions per supplier may be set through custom specifications and specification \\nentities with entity type 2-Supplier. \\n \\nEnable Internal Sales Orders (Internal Sales Orders) 13 (13) \\nHistoric Actual Cost (HAC) and Goods-in-transit (GIT) \\nThe Historic Actual Cost (HAC) calculation is not currently supported in combination with the \\nGoods in Transit (GIT) functionality. \\n \\nLine Charges \\nHeader charges have been setup to enable the addition of header charges at customer order \\nthat will be copied to the linked purchase order when the customer order is confirmed. \\nIt is also possible to add line charges, however this has not been configured in this IPC \\nsolution. \\n \\nSupply Chain Orders \\nIf supply chain orders are used, the specific settings for supply chain orders must also be set. \\nNote: If applicable, see Preconfigured Data – Supply Chain Orders. \\n \\nTransportation lead time \\nIn 'Supplier. Connect Transp Lead Times' (PPS010), both fields 'Transportation lead time 1' \\n(TLE1) and 'Transportation lead time 2' (TLE2) are enabled if the supplier is type 7 (internal). \\nThis allows for the suppliers internal lead time to be taken into account when determining the \\ntotal lead time for internal orders. \\nA detailed explanation of how this can affect planning dates can be found in the M3 Business \\nEngine User Documentation , document 'Material Planning for Internal Sales', section 'Lead \\ntime management'.\"}"
